# F1inSchools
A school project where we had to design, manufacture, and then race miniature compressed air powered cars. The group consisted of 4 people in total. 
AutoDesk's AutoCAD was used for designing the miniature car. AutoDesk's Flow Design was used for simulating the drag of the design. 
Shoutout to <a href="https://www.gbs.ca/en/succen.html" title="GBS">GBS</a> for sponsoring the ceramic ball bearings for our car!
